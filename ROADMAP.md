# Roadmap

Recommended enhancements for future development, refreshed **2026-09-15 against v0.13.0**.
Grouped by theme rather than a strict backlog — pick based on what matters most to whoever
picks this up next. See `README.md` for the full current state and `EFFORT-ASSESSMENT.md` for
the original scoping writeup this project started from.

## Current release

**v0.13.0 — "The provider password never reaches the browser."** The day's nine releases
(v0.11.0–v0.13.0) began with the last big security item and then worked through what live use
exposed, in the order it surfaced:

- **v0.11.0** — the browser no longer sees the provider password at all. Playback goes through
  session-authenticated `/api/stream/<kind>/<id>.<ext>` and `/api/xtream` routes; the server
  injects the account's stored credentials. The password used to be in `/api/session`'s payload
  *and* in every `/live/<user>/<pass>/…` URL, which meant it landed in browser history and the
  reverse proxy's access log.
- **v0.11.1** — that change **broke the live transcoding fallback**, and nothing caught it:
  the client started handing the transcode entry points its own `/api/stream/…` path, which
  ffmpeg then resolved against the *provider* base, so the session produced no output at all
  while the player sat on an undecodable stream reporting `fragParsingError`. Also fixed: live
  was being transcoded as if it were a VOD file.
- **v0.12.0** — drag-to-pan the timeline; the channel panel names the category it shows.
- **v0.12.1** — a transcode now stops when its viewer goes away (reported as *"the transcoding
  is continuing, the directory is growing, but I am not streaming anything"*). The player says
  goodbye; the server stops any session nobody has fetched from for two minutes.
- **v0.12.2** — a transcode can no longer fill the disk. The 8 GB threshold had existed since
  v0.10.4 but was wired to nothing.
- **v0.13.0** — the guide drags in both directions, and the category panel actually resizes
  (its handle had been trapped inside the panel's own scroll container).

**The lesson this stretch earned:** three of those six were surfaced by *using* the thing, not
by reading it — an orphaned transcode, a disk threshold that protected nothing, and a resize
handle that hit-tested to a scrollbar. Reasoning about code was not enough; measuring it (or
watching it run) was.

The honest arc from the original port to today:

| Version | Headline |
|---|---|
| **v0.5.x** | Server-side EPG aggregation + drag-resizable panels (the pre-accounts baseline) |
| **v0.6.0** | **Real accounts, roles, and an admin console** — replaced the single shared `ACCESS_PASSWORD` |
| v0.6.1–v0.6.6 | Account-store hardening, real ffmpeg in the image, EPG section, fuzzy matching + caches |
| v0.6.7–v0.6.17 | Guide-parsing resilience (gzip, nested HTML), source retry/backoff, audio-drop → transcode |
| **v0.7.0** | **SQLite storage** + persistent favourites, history, and custom categories |
| v0.7.1–v0.7.2 | Resume playback (movies/series), land on Favourites |
| **v0.8.0** | Drag-and-drop ordering for favourites and custom categories |
| v0.8.1 | Channel artwork stored with entries |
| **v0.9.0** | **Global search, backup/restore, and a system health page** |
| v0.9.1–v0.9.2 | SSRF guard, sign-in throttling, Secure cookies; faster transcode start |
| **v0.10.0** | Unprivileged server + dedicated transcode disk |
| v0.10.1–v0.10.5 | Operator-visible failures: DB-unwritable, degraded health, disk headroom, signed-URL race |
| **v0.11.0** | **Provider password out of the browser** (session-authenticated stream/API routes) |
| v0.11.1 | Fixed the live transcode fallback that v0.11.0 broke (path mapping; live vs VOD) |
| **v0.12.0** | Drag-to-pan the guide; panel title names its category |
| v0.12.1–v0.12.2 | A transcode stops when its viewer goes, and cannot fill the disk |
| **v0.13.0** | Guide drags in both directions; the category panel really resizes |

**Where it stands (v0.13.0):** 63 source files plus 32 test files (**320 tests**), TypeScript
type-checks and ESLint clean, a SQLite-backed per-account library, encrypted credentials at
rest, no provider credential in the browser at all, Docker/GHCR packaging with a real
`HEALTHCHECK`, and live verification against a real provider (~6k channels / ~300k-programme
guide). UI behaviour is now verified with **real mouse and keyboard input** against a real
browser (Chrome over the DevTools Protocol — see the harness note under Quality). The pattern this project has earned: **find
failures live, name them plainly, and let the operator fix them from just the message.**

## Recently completed (previously on this roadmap)

- **Provider credentials never reach the browser** — v0.11.0. The last big security item from
  the original queue: stream and API traffic is addressed by the server, not by URLs carrying
  `<user>/<pass>`.
- **A transcode's lifecycle matches its viewer** — v0.12.1/v0.12.2. Stops when the viewer goes
  away (client goodbye + a two-minute idle sweep), deletes its directory, and refuses or stops
  before it can fill the disk.
- **Drag-to-pan the EPG in both directions** — v0.12.0/v0.13.0. Left/right through time
  (quarter-hour snapping), up/down through channels, one axis per gesture, and a drag never
  selects the channel it passed.
- **The category sidebar really resizes** — v0.13.0. The handle straddles the divider from the
  content column instead of living inside the panel's scroll container.
- **Track-switching UI for the transcode fallback** — `TrackControls.tsx` exposes audio and
  subtitle selectors (with an explicit Off for subtitles); hidden when the provider offers no
  choices.
- **Drag-resizable panels** — channel column, category sidebar, and the player/guide seam via
  one shared pointer-event hook with clamped, persisted sizes.
- **Additional EPG sources + server-side aggregation** — implemented and live-verified.
- **Per-session connection state** — request/session-scoped proxy targets extracted with tests.
- **Credential encryption at rest** — AES-256-GCM under `SESSION_SECRET`; the old browser
  `localStorage` login is gone.
- **Multi-user login system** — v0.6.0 accounts, roles and admin console.
- **`nodeUpstreamRequest.ts` under test** — the real-`http.Server` pattern from
  `proxyServer.test.ts` now covers the Node-vs-Electron swap point too.
- **Check for a new release and surface it** — `/api/version-check` plus an "update available"
  banner against the GitHub Releases API.
- **Global search, backup/restore, health page, disk-space reporting** — shipped across
  v0.9.0–v0.10.4.

## Open work

### 1. Live TV & playback

- **Catch-up / timeshift playback.** *Open — highest-value gap.* The provider already exposes
  `tv_archive` / `tv_archive_duration` on each channel, the server already proxies `/timeshift/`,
  and the EPG grid already *renders* past programmes — but selecting one does nothing. Wire the
  grid's past programmes to the already-proxied timeshift URL, bounded by the server's ingest
  window (24h back / 72h forward — widen deliberately if a longer look-back is wanted). The
  deliberate omission is documented in `EpgGrid.tsx` and `xmltv.ts`.
- **EPG grid keyboard navigation.** *Open (drag shipped in v0.13.0).* The guide now drags in
  both directions, 1:1 with the pointer; what remains is keyboard navigation — arrow keys to move
  the time window and the channel list, and a visible focus order through programmes. Worth doing
  alongside catch-up, since both make the grid the primary surface rather than a picture of one.
- **Player settings that persist.** *Open (partial).* `TrackControls` lets you switch audio /
  subtitle tracks live, but the choice resets per session and there is no quality or
  subtitle-styling surface. Persist the selected tracks per saved profile and add a compact
  player-settings panel (playback quality, subtitle styling, visible fallback status).

### 2. EPG & guide quality

- **Built-in public XMLTV presets.** *Open.* The login form takes raw URLs today; ship a picker
  of common public guides so users do not have to hunt for sources.
- **Manual channel→guide mapping + optional fuzzy joins.** *Open (partial).* Matching is
  deliberately conservative (exact id → normalized id → normalized display-name, unambiguous
  only), so a channel whose name genuinely differs from every guide entry (e.g. "BBC One HD
  London" vs "BBC One HD") still misses. Add a one-click "map this channel to a guide id"
  override, and optionally a fuzzy/substring pass offered as a suggestion rather than applied
  silently.

### 3. Reliability & operations

*(This theme is informed directly by the 2026-09-15 disk-full outage: a 100%-full root
filesystem surfaced only as SQLite `disk I/O error`, and the space had gone to Docker image
bloat — 89 images / 55 GB, 40 GB reclaimable.)*

- **Free-space guardrail.** *Shipped in v0.12.2.* Headroom is reported at boot and over
  `/api/health`, a transcode is refused below a threshold that depends on its kind (8 GB for a
  film, 256 MB for a live channel), and every session is stopped if free space falls below
  256 MB. What remains is a **design question rather than a guard**: a film deliberately keeps
  every segment while it plays (that is what makes it scrubbable), so a 2h20 feature holds 10 GB+
  for its runtime. Decide whether to bound that — cap the retained window and give up far-back
  scrubbing, or accept it now that the disk cannot actually fill.
- **Update/upgrade tooling for image bloat.** *Open.* Every release adds a ~1 GB image to the
  host. Document/script a Watchtower sidecar or a scheduled `docker image prune`, since the
  in-app banner (v0.9.x) only *notifies* — it cannot replace a running container from inside
  itself.
- **Degraded-health alerting.** *Open.* Let `/api/health` push to a webhook (ntfy / Gotify /
  Discord) when it flips to `degraded`, so a full disk or an unwritable DB pings the operator
  instead of waiting to be discovered.
- **Skip the multi-arch image build for docs-only commits.** *Open.* Every push to `main`
  builds a full multi-arch image (~15 min, arm64 `better-sqlite3` under emulation), including
  commits that touch only markdown. A `paths-ignore` on `**.md` in the workflow would save that
  time and keep CI meaningful.

### 4. Deployment

- **Reverse-proxy / TLS docs for non-Synology hosts.** *Open.* Document a Caddy or nginx setup
  for self-hosters running anywhere other than a Synology box with its own reverse proxy.
- **Confirm a real Synology deployment.** *Open.* The Synology section is reasoning-based
  ("compatible, not yet confirmed deployed"); a real hardware walkthrough would catch anything
  the reasoning missed.
- **Decide the WAN-exposure posture.** *Open — a policy question, not just engineering.* The
  server relays the provider's stream and holds the Xtream credentials itself; document (and
  ideally enforce) whether it should ever be reachable off-LAN without a VPN in front.

### 5. Multi-user & security

- **Durable session service.** *Open.* Sessions expire after 24h of inactivity today; grow the
  browser session store into a service with explicit expiry and revocation so multiple tabs and
  restarts behave predictably.
- **Per-account scoping.** *Open (verify).* Favourites, history and custom categories are
  already per-account in SQLite; confirm the same for EPG sources and provider target selection
  as the household model grows toward a real user model.

### 6. Quality & testing

- **A repeatable live-verification checklist.** *Open.* A fixed script (login → saved
  credentials → reload → EPG → play a channel that hits the EC-3 fallback) so future changes get
  the same "verify live, don't just reason about it" confirmation this project's history relies
  on, without rediscovering the steps each time.
- **End-to-end coverage.** *Open (partly available).* No Playwright, but a real-browser
  harness now exists: Chrome over the DevTools Protocol driven from Node's built-in WebSocket,
  with genuine `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`/`KeyEvent` and `elementFromPoint` assertions. That is
  what proved the v0.13.0 divider fix (the pixel at the divider hit-tests to the handle; dragging
  it moves the panel; a 120px drag scrolls the list exactly 120px). Fold it into a scripted
  login → EPG → drag → play check so the next UI claim is measured rather than reasoned.
- **Keep extending the real-server test pattern.** *Ongoing.* `proxyServer.test.ts` and
  `nodeUpstreamRequest.test.ts` spin up a real `http.Server`; extend that to the transcode and
  EPG fetch paths where live behaviour has diverged from reasoning before.
